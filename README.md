## My process/Challenges
Initially this was supposed to be a quick exercise to keep my HTML + CSS skills sharp, while also trying out SASS/SCSS. I started having some trouble with layout since I relied too much on flexbox in places where a simpler solution would be better for the use case. 

Overall this was a good exercise for practicing mobile-first designs, responsive layouts, and SASS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [How to setup SASS in VSCode](https://onedebos.wordpress.com/2019/08/01/how-to-setup-sass-in-vscode/) - This helped me with setting up SASS. 
- [Images not showing in Github Pages](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41468951/images-not-displaying-in-github-pages) - Changing the url of the href to have a "." in the front fixed it.
